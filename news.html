		<p>I went to a party last night!<i>(that's incredibly rare for me these days, thus why its worth posting)</i>  All the old, and some new, GMs from Final Fantasy XI showed up and some other friends of the host.  The event was in celebration of Ruth's birthday and I hope she enjoyed it as much as I did.  We all got drunk and stuff and I had I think four beers and a shot of something blue.  Yes I threw up and no I didn't pass out on the couch.. Ruth did :D.  Again, I had a wonderful time, and I'd like to thank Paul for making the night possible.<a href="#">...read more</a></p>

			<p>Today I started working on the other pages of the site, hopefully I can get done in time to head to the party at Paul's house and get my mingle on.  I'm about 40% satisfied with the page, it's got decent colors and the layout should actually work well once I put more time into it.  Again always happy to receive feedback. <a href="anthony.sperry@gmail.com">e-mail</a><br /><a href="">...read more</a></p>

		<h3><a href="detail.html"><i>8-15-08</i></a></h3>
			<p>I really have no idea as to what it was that I was doing on this particular day, but since it was about a week ago I can safely assume I was working diligently on a task that my brother gave to me. Maybe we saw a movie or I went out for food, who knows.<br /><a href="">...read more</a></p>

			<p>Another dismal day of have no idea as to what it was I did.  I like the picture of the newspaper I happened to find, which should actually be updated with an image of the current topic rather than a paper, but I'm sure you can understand the situation.<br /><a href="">...read more</a></p>

		<h3><a href="detail.html"><i>8-1-08</i></a></h3>
			<p>So the idea for the news layout is virtually the same.  These four elements will be filled with the last four updates.  The updates can and will be in regards to anything, my blog, ffxi, work, site related, etc.  When it's up and running there should never be less than four updates up.<br /><a href="">...read more</a></p>
